# StackPulse-Protocol Contract

## Overview
The **StackPulse-Protocol Contract** is a next-generation DeFi analytics protocol built on Stacks. It provides advanced multi-tier staking, governance mechanisms, and emergency control features, making it a robust solution for managing on-chain financial analytics and community-driven decision-making.

## Features
- **Fungible Token (ANALYTICS-TOKEN):** Native platform token used for rewards and governance.
- **Staking System:** Multi-tier staking with reward multipliers based on stake amount and lock duration.
- **Governance Module:** Decentralized proposal creation and voting system.
- **Emergency Features:** Contract pause and resume functionality for security and stability.
- **Cooldown Mechanism:** Timed unstaking with a mandatory waiting period.

## Contract Constants
- **Contract Owner:** `tx-sender` (Deployer of the contract).
- **Errors:** Predefined error codes for better error handling.
- **Contract Status:** Variables to pause or activate emergency mode.

## Data Structures
### Staking Configuration
- **stx-pool:** Tracks the total STX staked in the contract.
- **base-reward-rate:** The base reward rate (5%).
- **bonus-rate:** Additional staking rewards for long-term commitments.
- **minimum-stake:** Minimum amount required to participate in staking.
- **cooldown-period:** Time required before unstaking can be completed.

### Governance
- **Proposals:** A map storing active governance proposals.
- **proposal-count:** Counter for tracking proposal IDs.

### User and Staking Data
- **UserPositions:** Tracks user staking details, tier level, and voting power.
- **StakingPositions:** Stores individual staking positions and rewards.
- **TierLevels:** Defines different staking tiers and their respective benefits.

## Contract Functions

### Initialization
#### `initialize-contract`
Initializes tier levels and verifies ownership.

### Staking
#### `stake-stx (amount uint, lock-period uint)`
Allows users to stake STX with an optional lock period for higher rewards.

#### `get-tier-info (stake-amount uint)`
Determines a userâ€™s staking tier based on their staked amount.

#### `calculate-lock-multiplier (lock-period uint)`
Calculates the reward multiplier based on the lock duration.

### Unstaking
#### `initiate-unstake (amount uint)`
Begins the unstaking process and triggers a cooldown period.

#### `complete-unstake`
Finalizes the unstaking process after the cooldown period ends.

### Rewards Calculation
#### `calculate-rewards (user principal, blocks uint)`
Computes staking rewards based on the duration and reward multiplier.

### Governance
#### `create-proposal (description string-utf8, voting-period uint)`
Allows eligible users to submit proposals for governance.

#### `vote-on-proposal (proposal-id uint, vote-for bool)`
Enables users to vote for or against active proposals.

### Emergency Functions
#### `pause-contract`
Pauses all contract activities for security purposes.

#### `resume-contract`
Resumes normal contract operations after a pause.

## How to Use
### Staking
1. Call `stake-stx` with the desired amount and lock duration.
2. The contract updates your tier and assigns rewards accordingly.

### Unstaking
1. Call `initiate-unstake` to start the unstaking cooldown.
2. After the cooldown period, call `complete-unstake` to withdraw your STX.

### Governance
1. Create a proposal using `create-proposal` if eligible.
2. Vote on proposals using `vote-on-proposal` before the deadline.

### Emergency Management
- The contract owner can pause or resume the contract as needed.

## Potential Use Cases
- **DeFi Protocols:** Integrate staking analytics for risk assessment.
- **DAO Governance:** Utilize decentralized voting for community decisions.
- **Financial Insights:** Provide on-chain analytics for stakeholders.
